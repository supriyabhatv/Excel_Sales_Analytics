## Skills and Techniques Used:
Here's a brief explanation of each skill used in the project:
- ETL Process: Applied Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) processes to integrate and transform raw sales data into clean and structured datasets suitable for analysis.
- Power Query: Utilized Power Query for advanced data cleaning, merging, and transformation tasks, ensuring data accuracy and consistency before loading it into the data model.
- Data Modeling: Established data models within Power Pivot to organize and structure the data, facilitating relationships between different datasets and enabling more comprehensive analysis.
- Power Pivot: Created data models and relationships between datasets, enabling the creation of pivot tables directly from the data models for efficient data analysis.
- DAX Formulas: Used Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) formulas such as DIVIDE, CALCULATE, and SUM for complex calculations and in-depth analysis.
- Pivot Tables: Created dynamic pivot tables directly from the data models, allowing for efficient summarization and analysis of the sales data.

This project reinforced my Excel skills, particularly in Power Pivot, Power Query, pivot tables, and DAX formulas, by applying them to real-world data analysis for AtliQ Hardware. Through ETL processes, data modeling, and visualization, I gained insights into sales trends and performance, enabling data-driven decision-making to optimize sales strategies. Effective communication of insights highlighted the importance of clear reporting, emphasizing the need for continuous learning and adaptation in data analytics.
